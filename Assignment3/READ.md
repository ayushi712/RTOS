**HOW TO RUN**:
1.Compile the server's program first in both the system and then the client
2.Run both server and client parallely in both system.
3.Provide the IP of other system in the run command of client code i.e "./client <IP Address>"

**PROBLEMS FACED**:
1.The recorded playback of the other system was kept repeating
2.The voice was not clear.
3.My own voice was also playing back in my server instead of playing back in the other system's server.

**HOW DO I RESOLVED THE PROBLEMS**
1.I tried using headphones to avoid the noise recording along with the original voice.
